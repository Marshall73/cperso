Hi.

ControlNet Tile is a great tool for image upscaling. But after some experiments I have discovered that it's fantastic for photo editing as well.

I took a photo of the chihuahua (thanks to my sister; it's her dog) and turned it into different kinds of animals. The result is in this post. Please note that the poses of generated animals are the same as on the original photo, and the background has been left mostly unchanged. It is very hard to get such a result with a usual img2img.

My workflow includes inpainting with two ControlNets - tile and inpaint_only, and denoising strength set to 1. Normally such high denoising changes an image dramatically, but due to ControlNet tile the original shape is preserved. What about ControlNet inpaint_only it is not strongly necessary but makes inpainting more consistent with complex backgrounds.

The detailed workflow for AUTOMATIC1111:

Take a photo of your pet. Preferably full body, high quality, good lighting.

Select a realistic model (Edge Of Realism, Realistic Vision, Reliberate and so on).

Enter a simple prompt, such as “cat” if you want to turn a dog into a cat.

Enter a negative prompt: “lowres, text, error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, out of frame, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck, username, watermark, signature”.

Configure inpainting: original, only masked, "768 x 768", denoising strength "1". Select all the body of your pet with a mask.

Add ControlNet tile: preprocessor “none”, model “control_v11f1e_sd15_tile“, "Pixel perfect", "ControlNet is more important". Don't add any image to ControlNet.

Add ControlNet inpaint_only: preprocessor “inpaint_only”, model “control_v11p_sd15_inpaint“, "Pixel perfect", "ControlNet is more important". Don't add any image to ControlNet.

Generate!

Tips and tricks:

Use other ControlNet modes or weight less than 1, if it does not follow your prompt well enough.

Inpaint the head separately from other parts of the body if you need more control.

Reinpaint separate areas of the image with low denoising strength to increase quality.

Experiment with prompts: more words, not only animals and so on.

What do you think about this technique? Please, share your result! I hope we could find even more unusual applications of ControlNet Tile.
